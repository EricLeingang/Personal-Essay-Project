This code represents all of the statistical analyses contained with my final undergraduate paper in psychology, and is written in the R programming language.  Within you will find the exact methods used to create all data within tables and plots.  The raw data is hosted locally and remains confidential.  Contact professor Mark Snyder at the University of Minnesota Volunteerism Lab for access.  The correlation matrix presented within the paper should allow a reproduction of the factor analysis.
